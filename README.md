! The news section has only financial news, emphasis on financial literacy from the big dogs.

! So for the savings, this is the idea: 
so two types of savings right, time bound and fixed goal bound. So by default, there are 3 months and 6 months and 1 year savings goals. The user can start savings on it and will only have access to it when time is up

But for the money bound, you  set a money goal and until you reach it, you get access to it.

    How will it be coded?, I have no idea. 

So the user can actually cash out before time but when they do, they loose money, which should be stated for the user to know before they start the account. 
    -like terms of service or something. 

The user should be able to move money from one savings into another, but I'm not to sure on that one. 

ALso the users need to choose for notifications that remind them to save, they can pick weekly or monthly or daily, by default it's daily. 

Let's automate some part of the app too, if you know you can save consistently every month then at the bigging of every month you get the notifacation to save. 
And let's add a credit card option, if the user want's to , they can sign up to be deducted a fixed amount into a specific account every couple of days or weeks or month.

##update
Let's keep the savings section at a fair height by default so that even if there's no savings plan, it takes up some small space.
