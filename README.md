! The news section has only financial news, emphasis on finanfial literacy from the big dogs.

! So for the savings, this is the idea: 
so two types of savings right, time bound and fixed goal bound. So by default, there are 3 months and 6 months and 1 year savings goals. The user can start savings on it and will only have access to it when time is up

But for the money bound, you  set a money goal and until you reach it, you get access to it.

    How will it be coded?, I have no idea. 

So the user can actually cash out before time but when they do, they loose money, which should be stated for the user to know before they start the account. 
    -like terms of service or something. 

The user should be able to move money from one savings into another, but I'm not to sure on that one.
